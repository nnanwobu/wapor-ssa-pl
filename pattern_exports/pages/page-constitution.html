The Electoral Committee will consist of a minimum of three and a maximum of five members appointed by the Committee Chair. The committee composition shall reflect the breadth and diversity of WAPOR SSA membership.

Before 2025, these nominations shall include all qualified nominees with 10 or more votes on the nomination canvas.

The announcement has to take place before December 15. The winner will be announced on the WAPOR SSA homepage and via email. Notwithstanding what is mentioned here, the Association shall have an Inaugural Caretaker Executive Committee consisting of the President, Vice-President, Secretary-Treasurer to be appointed by the founding members after the ratification of WAPOR SSA and will serve till the end of 2023.</p> <p><strong>5.5</strong> A Business Meeting shall be held at least once every year to discuss business or professional matters.
